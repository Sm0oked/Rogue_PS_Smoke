# Enhanced Targeting System Integration

This document outlines how the enhanced targeting system has been integrated into all AOE spells in the Death Trap Rogue script.

## Current Spell Rotation Integration

The enhanced targeting system is fully integrated with the current spell rotation:

### Core Rotation Spells with Enhanced Targeting:
1. **Caltrop** - Optimized AoE placement for area control and crowd control
2. **Smoke Grenade** - Intelligent defensive positioning for enemy disruption
3. **Poison Trap** - Optimal trap placement for maximum damage over time
4. **Shadow Clone** - Optimal positioning for clone summoning with maximum enemy coverage
5. **Penetrating Shot** - Linear targeting optimization for maximum penetration
6. **Dance of Knives** - Optimized channeling position with dynamic updates

### Additional Spells with Enhanced Targeting:
- **Death Trap** - Optimized AoE placement for maximum enemy coverage
- **Rain of Arrows** - Optimized area targeting for maximum damage potential
- **Barrage** - Linear targeting for maximum enemy penetration

## How Enhanced Targeting Works

The enhanced targeting system provides several benefits:

1. **Optimal Position Calculation**: Uses a sophisticated algorithm to find the best position to cast AoE spells
2. **Target Prioritization**: Weighs targets based on their type (normal, elite, champion, boss)
3. **Visual Feedback**: Shows targeting information when debug mode is enabled
4. **Smart Filtering**: Respects filter settings (e.g., elite/boss only modes)
5. **Boss Exception Logic**: Bypasses minimum enemy count when bosses are present
6. **Linear Spell Optimization**: Special handling for linear spells like Penetrating Shot

## Different Targeting Types

The enhanced targeting system handles different spell types in specific ways:

1. **Circular AoE Spells** (Caltrop, Smoke Grenade, Poison Trap, Death Trap, etc.) - Finds the optimal position to hit the most enemies
2. **Linear Spells** (Penetrating Shot, Barrage) - Finds the best direction to hit multiple enemies in a line
3. **Channeled Spells** (Dance of Knives) - Finds the best location to channel for maximum effect with dynamic updates
4. **Summon Spells** (Shadow Clone) - Places summons in optimal positions for maximum effectiveness

  - Aggressive spamming after main rotation
  - Enhanced targeting for optimal linear positioning

### Dance of Knives (Special Timing)

  - Pause functionality in dangerous areas
  - Shadow Imbuement dependency checking
  - 12-second timer logic following Shadow Clone
  - Enhanced targeting for maximum effect during channel

## Configuration

The enhanced targeting system can be enabled and configured in the menu:

1. Go to `Enhancements > Enhanced Targeting`
2. Enable `Enhanced Targeting` option
3. Configure additional settings:
   - `AoE Optimization` - Enables optimized AoE spell positioning
   - `Smart Target Selection` - Uses improved target selection algorithm
   - `Boss Exception` - Bypasses minimum enemy count for bosses
   - `Linear Optimization` - Optimizes linear spells like Penetrating Shot

## Visualization

When debug mode is enabled, you can see the enhanced targeting in action:

1. Spell ranges are shown as circles around the player
2. Potential targets are highlighted with color coding:
   - Red: Boss enemies
   - Purple: Elite enemies
   - White: Normal enemies
3. Actual effect areas are shown when spells are cast
4. Targeting decisions are displayed with reasoning

## Benefits

The enhanced targeting system provides several advantages:

1. **Increased Efficiency**: Hits more enemies with each cast
2. **Better Resource Usage**: Ensures spells are only cast when they will be effective
3. **Improved Target Selection**: Prioritizes the most dangerous enemies
4. **Faster Decision Making**: Quickly determines the optimal position without player intervention
5. **Boss Fight Optimization**: Ensures optimal spell usage during boss fights
6. **Rotation Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the current spell rotation

## Implementation Details

Each spell has been updated to:

1. Import the enhanced targeting and enhancements manager modules
2. Update spell range information for visualization
3. Try the enhanced targeting before falling back to standard targeting
4. Provide detailed feedback on targeting decisions
5. Implement boss exception logic for minimum enemy count
6. Use appropriate targeting methods for different spell types

## Performance Considerations

- Enhanced targeting calculations are cached to reduce performance impact
- Targeting refresh rate is configurable for performance tuning
- Early returns when minimum enemy count isn't met
- Efficient enemy counting with cached results

## Troubleshooting

If enhanced targeting isn't working as expected:

1. Make sure enhanced targeting is enabled in the menu
2. Check that the spell is enabled
3. Verify that the minimum enemy threshold settings aren't too high
4. Try increasing the spell radius or range values
5. Check if boss exception logic is working correctly
6. Verify that spell-specific settings are properly configured

The enhanced targeting system should significantly improve your damage output and efficiency when using AoE spells, especially with the current spell rotation that prioritizes area control and defensive positioning.
